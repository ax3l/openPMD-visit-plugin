### Implementing a new feature

- Switch to the development branch
```

```

- Start a new branch from the development branch, in order to implement a new feature. (Choose a branch name that is representative of the feature that you are implementing)
```

```

- Start coding. When your changes are ready, commit them.
```

git commit
```

### Testing your implementation

### Adding your change to the main repository

- Synchronize your branch with the main repository. (It may have changed while you where implementing local changes.) Resolve merging issues if any, and commit the corresponding changes.
```
git pull git@github.com:openPMD/openPMD-visit-plugin.git dev
```

- Push the changes to your personal copy on Github
```
git push -u origin <NewBranchName>
```

- Go on your Github account and create a pull request between your new feature branch and the `develop` branch of the main repository. Please add some text to the pull request to describe what feature you just implemented and why. Please also make sure that the automated tests (on Github) return no error.
